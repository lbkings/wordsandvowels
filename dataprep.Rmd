##find zero crossing point for each subject 
## more zero crossing points in words than vowels should be interesting finding

## find multiple x intercepts on seperate graphs for Embedded v NonEmbedded 
# want to know where clusters on on TTPosition for each individual -- code will tel you for each subject how many means they have -- k means clustering for each subject to bin them separately -- show uncertainty for k means is different for words than non words 
#make graphs for each subject (19): ggplot(wordsandvowels, aes(x = TTPosition, y = PositionDiff)) + geom_boxplot(trim = FALSE) - subject number and condition (word or vowel) -- made into a raincloud or dot plot or barcode or others

### create graph (scatterplot) with TTPosition (all tones on X axis) and Position Difference on Y axis and see if there is a crossover between tones in  (create two, one graph that is for words and the other for vowels)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
