# playing with plots - potential graphs for report 
## determining if there is a difference between position chosen for words and vowels by examining the position difference (or accuracy of selection based off trial or probe)


# use this for each subject to see position difference and tone position average across the range of tones 
ggplot(contextknowledgevowelwords) + aes(T3Low, T3High) + geom_jitter() + facet_grid(vars(Condition))



# Shannon Meeting Notes:
##find zero crossing point for each subject 
## more zero crossing points in words than vowels should be interesting finding 
#installing split violin plots --- for each Test tone whether it is embedded or not embedded (Condition = Embedded or Not Embedded, TTPosition as Y axis )
## find multiple x intercepts on seperate graphs for Embedded v NonEmbedded 
# want to know where clusters on on TTPosition for each individual -- code will tel you for each subject how many means they have -- k means clustering for each subject to bin them separately -- show uncertainty for k means is different for words than non words 
#make graphs for each subject (19): ggplot(wordsandvowels, aes(x = TTPosition, y = PositionDiff)) + geom_boxplot(trim = FALSE) - subject number and condition (word or vowel) -- made into a raincloud or dot plot or barcode or others 


#changed to categorical variable 
wordsandvowels$TTPosition <- as.factor(wordsandvowels$TTPosition)


#box plot comparing the ultimate position a person chose for the probe tone divided based on whether they had to listen to vowel continuum or a word 
ggplot(wordsandvowels) + 
  geom_bar(aes(UltPosition, fill = embedded)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c("pink", "lightblue"))



### create graph (scatterplot) with TTPosition (all tones on X axis) and Position Difference on Y axis and see if there is a crossover between tones in  (create two, one graph that is for words and the other for vowels)
## bias by test tone

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r table}
summary(cars)

library(papaja)
library(tidyverse)
r_refs("r-references.bib")
mydata <- as.tibble(mtcars, rownames = "model")

mytable <- mydata %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(
    mean.mpg = mean(mpg),
    sd.mpg = sd(mpg),
    n.models = n()
  )
apa_table(mytable, caption = "mpg stats by number of cylinders")




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
